# small-scale-Scala
This Repository has 2 small Scala programs for parsing input files and manipulating them.

The 1st one is a simple Scala program using the Akka Actor Model to parse a given text and find out number of occurrences of each letter.

The 2nd is a Scala application using Apache Spark that will parse the scores of last 5 seasons (seasons-1415 to season-1819) of the English Premier League and calculate total goals scored of each team in those 5 seasons.
